The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City to convince stakeholders that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The detailed bike trip analysis is to to solidify the proposal to present to stakeholders. 

For this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Analysis Results
Despite the differences between Des Moines and NYC, the initial results indicate that CitiBike might appeal to the former and stakeholders. 

The following image shows the number of riders that are subscribers and the gender breakdown.

## Analysis Summary
Overall, bikeshare services appear to be widely popular amongst metropolitan areas. The primary user base for bikeshare services skew towards male subscribers. Based on trip start/end times and duration, the primary usage is related to morning and evening commutes.

Studies of the traffic flow for bikeshare riders and a poll regarding safety concerns may be worth additional research for stakeholders.
